      Create an AngularJS directive that includes a text input element. Any text the user enters should be analyzed and a response output to the page. The input should accept simple equations, such as <code>2+3/2</code> and then output the appropriate answer, paying attention to the order of operations. <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>  and <code>/</code> are the only symbols that need to be accepted, and you cannot use the <code>eval</code> function. If the input is not valid, the output text should change to indicate this to the user.
